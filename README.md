**Task 2: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models**
This project demonstrates how to use pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion or DALLÂ·E-mini to create images from text prompts.
It uses Hugging Face Transformers and Diffusers libraries to load and run the model, generating high-quality images based on user-provided descriptions.

**Features**
Generate images from custom text prompts
Utilize powerful pre-trained models without training from scratch
Save generated images locally
Easily adaptable for different models (DALL-E-mini, Stable Diffusion, etc.)

**Requirements**
Install dependencies with:
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch safetensors

**Usage**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aneezhassan/PRODIGY_GA_02.git
cd PRODIGY_GA_02
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Provide your text prompt in the input cell.
Run all cells to generate and save images.

**Example Output**
Prompt:
A futuristic city skyline at sunset, in cyberpunk style
